Hello! sir...
My name is Pavan Prajapati,

And I have created a Responsive frontend website
in the project and website title is "web content".

About My Project -
      This website is made with the help of using
 3 languages ​​which are HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. 
This website is divided into 5 sections, the first
section is "Home", the second section is "About",
the third section is "Languages", the fourth section
is "Needs", and the last section is "Contact". And along 
with all these things, this website is also responsive,
which we can easily visit from computer devices as well
as small devices like iPhone, iPhoneex, Airpad,
surface duo or other devices.
